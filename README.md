# Panda Knits - Get unique knitwear here!

## Description

Winter is coming! Wrap yourself up in these homemade knits! In order to create this application, we implemented the four technologies of the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node for fullstack functionality. Additionally, Bootstrap was utilized for several UI features.

## Installation

- This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) application. It is recommended to use at least v16 (up to v18) for this app to run correctly.

- MongoDB is required for this app to run, so follow directions outlined [here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) for a step-by-step guide depending on your operating system.

### Dependencies

- Type the following in your terminal in the root directory to install all dependencies:

`npm install`

- Type the following to start the application in your local environment:

`npm run develop`

### Optional, but recommended:

- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to enable automatic restarting of your server upon any detected changes.

## Usage

The application deployed on Heroku can be found [here](https://panda-knits-847b929e7885.herokuapp.com/).

[Stripe payment](https://stripe.com/docs/development) was in test mode during development. It has not been activated for production so a sample checkout page was provided instead when you click on 'check out' in the deployed version.
